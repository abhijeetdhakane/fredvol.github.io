    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # 2. Setup Ruby (for the Ruby component such as Jekyll)
      - name: Setup Ruby 3.1
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.1'
          bundler-cache: true   # Caches Ruby gems

      # 3. Install Ruby dependencies (Gemfile must be present)
      - name: Install Ruby dependencies
        run: bundle install

      # 4. Setup Node.js (for processing SCSS and other assets)
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      # 5. Install Node dependencies (package-lock.json or yarn.lock must be present)
      - name: Install Node dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # 6. Build your site
      # For example, if your site is built with Jekyll,
      # this step processes your HTML, SCSS, etc. and outputs to the _site folder.
      - name: Build site with Jekyll
        run: bundle exec jekyll build
        # If you use a different build command (or both a Node and a Ruby build),
        # adjust this step accordingly. For instance, you might run `npm run build` as well.

      # 7. Deploy the built site to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        with:
          branch: gh-pages   # The branch from which Pages will be served
          folder: ./_site    # Adjust if your build output folder is different
